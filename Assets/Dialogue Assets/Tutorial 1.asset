  - content: 'Hello! You must be tech support, glad you''re here. Has anyone explained
      the situation to you? '
  - content: No? Not to worry, I'll bring you up to speed. One of our warehouses
      near the North Pole is experiencing some problems. All the doors suddenly locked
      themselves and now nobody can enter.
  - content: 'The doors are temperature-controlled, and they''re only supposed to
      lock in an emergency...but someone must have messed up when they made the system.
      Never trust contract labour, I tell you. '
  - content: 'Anyway, thankfully we''re prepared for these situations. Everything
      at our facility can be controlled remotely, so you shouldn''t have trouble
      fixing this. '
  - content: 'This room looks pretty chilly! Try clicking on the door to get a better
      look at the temperature readings. '
